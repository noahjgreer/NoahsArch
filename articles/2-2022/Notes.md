# Notes
## The argument that the Bible never talks about romance
This statement is false. Romance is brought up many different times in the Bible. It's so prominent that there is an entire book dedicated to it! Read the Songs of Solomon.

## Homosexuality
### The Bible Condemns all forms of Homosexuality
> Romans 1:26b

The Bible is subtlely clear that every act of Homosexuality is sinful. Let's break it down. "for their women exchanged the *natural function* for what was *unnatural.*" Let's set some definitions. The Bible is very clear about the natural functions of the body are. The love between a man and a woman, in any kind, is a *natural* function. God designed it that way. Kissing, attraction, and intimate love between them, are all **natural** things. Now, what is unnatural? Given the context of "natural function" that the Bible provides, it is exceedingly clear that it would be very *unnatural* if the things that God **set in place** were altered (by sin). A man and a woman no longer having those desires for each other is **unnatural**. Those desires now being exchanged between the same gender is *very* unnatural. __It's the opposite of what God designed! That's what makes it unnatural!__ If everything God made is perfect, then that perfection is the definition of natural. For his perfect creation to be twisted in **any way**, descending further into the depths of sin, is unnatural and __wrong.__
__**Counter Argument**__

## Actions Set to be Between a Man and a Woman
### The union and connection of the two.
#### Good Evidence
> Genesis 2:24

This is a solid verse for the topic of the union of a man and a woman. God says that a man will leave his parents and be *joined* to his wife. They will become *one*. This is  a **special** thing is only possible between a man and a woman. God brings together the man and the woman through marriage (Mark 10:9); God doesn't ever state it between two men. Throughout the entire Bible, this is the only place where the drasticity of the union of a man and a woman in marriage is stated in this simplicity.
__**Counter Argument**__
> 1 Samuel 18

Some people will bring up this passage to express a union between two men. However, this is not the case. Let's break it down. This chapter talks about **friendship** and **brotherly** love. This is drastically different than the love that is spoken of between a man and a woman throughout the Bible. You can absolutely love your friend in the same way you would love your brother.

> the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David...

Many people will say that this is "an act of God" but it is not. Jonathan and David knit their souls *themselves.* The Bible is clear about what God has an action in something. Look anywhere for evidence of that.

> ...and __Jonathan loved him as himself.__

Tell me. Do you love yourself like you love your wife? If you do, this is wrong to begin with; however, that's not the point. You love your wife with *romantic* love. You love your brother with *brotherly* love. You don't love your brother as you would your wife, right?



#### Poor evidence
> Genesis 1:27

A common argument used to fight towards this point, however, I find it to be very out of context. This is describing how God created man, and the genders he gave them. This would be more of a point to use in transgenderism than anything.

### Intimate Kissing between a man and a woman
> Songs of Solomon 1:2
The problem with this verse is the context in which it is. It is in the context of a Shulammite Bride being lovestruck over King Solomon. It's not happening, but it's instead a plead and a longing (present throughout the entire book, between the bride and the bridegroom). It's not held within marriage, so I find it challenging to use this verse towards the context of the topic.
