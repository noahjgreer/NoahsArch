        <h1>God's Design for Sexuality</h1>
        <h6>Pastor Matt Round<br>Thursday, March 3rd, 2022</h6>
        <p>
            Here is the foundational truth: God created sex, and it is good. Sex is not part of the fall, nor is sexuality or the desire for physical intimacy. They are all things that have been corrupted by the fall, which means that there is design and purpose
            and intent behind it that is good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back in the day (and you'll often hear this kind of pushed back against, especially right now), the idea of a "purity culture" developed, and all of these very hard lines were drawn, and a lot of those were really good and wise and based on biblical values.
            The problem was if you push those too far, then you start to see things like desires for physical intimacy as something terrible that has to be cut off, done away with, and ignored. That means that we don't talk about it, it means we don't
            think rightly about it, and it means that sex becomes viewed as something dirty, as worldly, and as "over <em>there</em>." But, that's not it at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, sexuality within God's confines and designs is a part of who we are as humans, creatures, and people who long for real intimacy because we are <em>made</em> for real intimacy. When we talk about these things, there has to be a context
            where we can talk about them rightly without embarrassment and without blushing, and certainly with maturity, but also without the fear that even to discuss those things takes us down a dangerous road. We must obviously express wisdom and
            discernment in how we talk about those and when we talk about those things. You have to understand that when you have those butterfly feelings for the cute guy or the cute girl, God programmed our attraction to people at some level. Whether
            you know it or not, that is the beginning of the desire for physical intimacy. Physical intimacy is not solely based on physical looks; that is obvious, but don't get so caught up in the wrong side of this that we begin to think incorrectly
            about why God put it there in the first place.
        </p>

            <h><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/100/1TI.4.1-2" target="_blank">1 Timothy 4:1-5</a></h>
            <br><sup>1</sup>But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, <sup>2</sup>by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience
            as with a branding iron, <sup>3</sup>men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth. <sup>4</sup>For everything created by God is good, and
            nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude; <sup>5</sup>for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.
