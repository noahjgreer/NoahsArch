# Homosexual Relationships
## *What does the Bible say regarding the topics of two people of the same gender being in the same relationship, and where are the lines drawn for kissing?*

Homosexuality has riddled this world in all places. It's everywhere. When you go and walk around a shopping center, you may pass by many signs and posters promoting and propagating the "pride" movement, and you may also walk by people promoting those things publically; whether it be throught their clothing, their lifestyles, or other subtle gestures.

## Context is Everything

## The Bible Condemns *all* forms of Homosexuality

(See notes.md)

<!-- By the way, here is information you were seeking on homosexual relationships, kissing and stuff. Romans 1:26-27 "26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."
Think about the words "natural use", what do you think it means? Is it JUST sexual activity? Of course not. What happens when you kiss on the lips? You start feeling things: desires. There are clearly two types of kissing: brotherly kiss (on the cheek, as parents or siblings would (non-sexual), and kissing between a married man and woman (the intimate kind))
Anyone who thinks that lip-kissing and romantic relationships is ok as long as no sex is involved is a fool, to be blunt. There are actions clearly designed for marriage. And being without natural affection does involve homosexual kissing. How the leadership of CFF think otherwise is beyond me
Romans 1:31 "Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
1 Timothy 2:3 "Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
Think about it. What do married couples do?
Cuddle and lip kiss.
Even if two of the same gender aren't immediately feeling sexual desires while kissing, it's still a sin. It's like saying it's okay to stare at a woman as long as I don't actually sleep with her ðŸ™„
A friend of mine on the server even said he was gay before he was saved, and that this belief of theirs is foolish
Let me ask you a rhetorical question. Is cohabitation okay (two unmarried of opposite gender living together) as long as they don't have sex? The Bible clearly says "for this cause (marriage) shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife" Paraphrasing but you get my point
The cold hard truth is this.

Many in the CFF, and the leadership therein, put society and culture (the world) before God and what his Word says. They put more emphasis on outside definitions and standards than God's Word. That's why, I believe, so many there are lost and confused. This is one reason why I've stepped away from the server aside from being busy
Another thing to consider is if they say their "bible" says it's okay, it ain't the real deal.
God's Word never condones sin of any kind. It is QUICK, ,and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, PIERCING and dividing assunder (paraphrasing again).
God's Word is supposed to convict of sin.
Seriously I can't believe people are still trying to convince themselves this is okay....
And so many people seem to be so "knowledgeable" about Bible yet they are so far gone (deceiving and being deceived as the Bible says in 2 Timothy) -->
